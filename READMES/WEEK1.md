# Hacktoberfest2018 ~ Week 1 Challenge

# Friends-List 
Welcome! I need some help making my website, I'm writing a list of all my friends!

# You have friends...?
Believe it or not... **No!** 
But hey, listen, you can be my friend!
All you need to do is make an HTML file in the `Friends` folder

# Html file?
Yes! Html file!
I bet you're wondering what it should have inside. 
That's the thing, I dont have many friends, so I dont know what friends do.

I've got the best idea, my friends should make ***HTML FILES*** that have their username as the filename, for example 
`raidandfade.html`

***YOUR FILE NAME MUST BE YOUR GITHUB URL (ex: https://github.com/raidandfade -> raidandfade.html)***

***Your GITHUB URL (ex: https://github.com/raidandfade) MUST BE CLEARLY VISIBLE, ACCURATE, AND UNIQUE.***

# HTML File Rules
**Your HTML file can include *anything you want*, as long as it follows this ruleset:**
1. No Malicious Code (cookie sniffing, iframe hacking, css local file stealing, ios rootkits, while loops that never end, CPU Monero Miners)
2. No NSFW (porn, nudes, pictures of your cat's testicles, severed heads)
3. No ADS (No advertising your product, No having third party ads)
4. Only a single file may be added per GitHub account. That's one. O N E.

# Final Note
Remember to be friendly, you're here to make friends.
